In this day in age of AI and LLMs, writing is a skill that is going to decay over time for many of us and that's not going to be a good thing for the world. We cannot let an LLM regurgitate it's own boring letter to your friend thanking them for the birthday gifts (where's the creativity and personal touch?!). It's the one skill that I'm hoping to hone more of in the coming months. I've come to believe that writing is THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL because it impacts how you're perceived in all facets of life. You appear more well spoken because the words come more easily to you. You garner an image of expertise because you're able to clearly and succinctly express your ideas. But most of all - it forces you to organize the many zooming thoughts and abstract ideas in your brain into something tangible that someone else can read. It brings a calm to the madness that is your brain. My goal is to tame this and write about more software engineering/career related topics within this blog and share what my runs through my nerdy brain. Hopefully more frequently this time around ðŸ¤ž
