Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post, created to demonstrate how easy it is to add content using Hugo and the PaperMod theme.

## How It Works

To create a new post like this one, you simply add a new Markdown file to the `content/posts/` directory. Hugo automatically picks it up and renders it as a new page on your site.

The block of text at the top of this file is called **front matter**. It's written in YAML and contains metadata about the post.

```

-   **title**: The title that appears at the top of the page.
-   **date**: The publication date. Posts are sorted by this date.
-   **draft**: If `true`, the post won't be published. Set to `false` when you're ready to share.
-   **summary**: A short description that appears on list pages, like the homepage or archives.
-   **tags**: Keywords that help categorize your content.

## Markdown Fun

You can use standard Markdown to format your text. Here are a few examples.

### Code Blocks

You can include code blocks with syntax highlighting.

```python
def greet(name):
    """A simple function to greet someone."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my new blog.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet("World")
```

### Blockquotes

> The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
>
> &mdash; Laozi
